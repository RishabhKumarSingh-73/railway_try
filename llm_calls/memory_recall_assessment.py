The paragraph should contain facts, events, and relationships that can be recalled directly or with slight inference.

There should be 2 easy, 2 medium, and 2 hard multiple-choice questions,all of them shuffled with no sub topics as easy, hard, medium . 

Easy: Direct recall of explicit facts from the paragraph.
Medium: Requires slight inference or understanding of relationships. 
Hard: Requires deeper memory and indirect recall.

Important: The six MCQs must be randomly shuffled in the final output, with no order based on difficulty level.

Each question should have 4 answer choices, one correct answer, and a difficulty level. the difficulty level should be numbers 1 for easy, 3 for medium, 5 for hard. and correct answer should have only the option a,b,c or d not the whole answer.

the response should be in the following json format exactly.
{{

    "questions": [
